# Advent of Code 2019

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/). Thanks to [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl) for great puzzles and a great time.

These are my attempt for the year 2019. I wanted to learn Rust (started at version 1.48) and I hope I succeeded to get the hange of this strange language for just a bit.

My goal was to finished at least one puzzle on a given day. And to try to use a few addidtional crates as possible.
