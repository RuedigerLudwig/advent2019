# Advent of Code 2019

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/). Thanks to [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl) for the great puzzles and a great time I had solving them.

These are my attempts for the year 2019. I wanted to learn Rust (started at version 1.48 finished at 1.49) and I would say I succeeded to get the hange of this strange language for just a bit.

My goal was to finish at least one puzzle on a given day. And to try to use a few additional crates as possible. I did not quite succeed in the former, but at least I solved every single puzzle alone. I am quite pround of a few of them. I learned a lot. Not only about rust, but also on how to approach certain riddles.

If you look at the code and see ways I could improve it, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am always grateful for everything that makes me a better programmer.

Also, if you ever look for a programmer and think my code is any good, please also contact me at once.
